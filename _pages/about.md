I am a fourth year PhD student at the Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick, in the [Theory and Foundations](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/research/focs/) group. I graduated from the Mathematics Institute, University of Warwick, in the summer of 2019 with a BSc in Mathematics. My research area is privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs), specifically [Differential Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy). In 2022, I published two papers on developing differentially private methods for releasing aggregated multi-dimensional messages. I am currently working on characterising data heterogeneity in the framework of federated learning, in conjunction with the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/). I am also working on a differentially private method for estimating the distribution of populations, in collaboration with [Sayan Biswas](https://people.epfl.ch/sayan.biswas?lang=en).
