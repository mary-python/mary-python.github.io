As of February 2025, I have defended my PhD thesis and am on track to receive my doctorate in July 2025.

I am now working as a Data Scientist in the [Infectious Diseases Data Observatory (IDDO)](https://www.iddo.org/), based at the Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health in Oxford.

I perform large-scale individual patient data meta-analyses, methods development, and statistical modelling to optimise the treatment of infectious disease.

My research focuses on improving the diagnosis and triage of patients with suspected severe malaria.
